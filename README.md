## Shadow Network

A networked Kinect + openFrameworks + MaxMSP installation for two remote performers. Further project details, documentation and demos can be found [here](http://cezar.io/shadownetwork).

**Project Context**

* Built during Summer 2020, as a team of two, through a grant from the New York City Media Lab. I was involved in concept development, visual design and openFrameworks programming. My teammate worked on concept development, sound design and MaxMSP programming.

* The total project development timeline was 10 weeks, from accepted proposal to functional demo.
